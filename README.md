## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js v14+**
- **npm** or **yarn**

### üì• Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Movie-TV-App`
2. `cd Movie-TV-App`

3. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

In order to run the application locally, you need to create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project. This file will store sensitive information like the **TheMovieDB** access token and API base URLs.

### Setting up `.env.local`

1. Go to [TheMovieDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and sign up (or log in).
2. Once logged in, go to your **Account Settings** and navigate to the **API** section to generate your **API access token**. In this case, we're using an **access token** rather than an API key.
3. In the root of your project, create a `.env.local` file if it doesn't exist.
4. Add the following environment variables to the `.env.local` file:

NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_READ_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_tmdb_access_token
NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_BASE_URL=https://api.themoviedb.org/3
NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGE_BASE_URL=https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500

5. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
